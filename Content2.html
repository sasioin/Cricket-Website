            <li><a href="#material">Material</a></li>
            <li><a href="#size">Size</a></li>

        </ul>
        
        <h2 id="material">Material</h2>
        <p>The material of your cricket bat can greatly impact your performance on the field. There are three main materials to choose from:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>English Willow:<br><br><i>the best material for cricket bats, it offers superior performance and durability, but also comes with a higher price tag.</i></li>
            <li>Kashmir Willow:<br><br><i>a more affordable option, but not as durable or high-performing as English Willow.</i></li>
            <li>Carbon Fibre:<br><br><i>a newer material in the cricket bat market, it offers lightweight and high-performance benefits, but can be quite expensive.</i></li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 id="size">Size</h2>
        <p>The size of your cricket bat is also important to consider. You want to choose a size that feels comfortable and allows you to perform at your best. Some factors to keep in mind include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Age and height of the player</li>
            <li>Playing style and position</li>
            <li>Personal preference</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 id="weight">Weight</h2>
        <p>The weight of your cricket bat can also impact your performance. Some things to consider when choosing a weight include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Player strength and skill level</li>
            <li>Playing style and position</li>
            <li>Personal preference</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 id="price">Price</h2>
        <p>Of course, price is also an important factor when choosing a cricket bat. While you don't want to skimp on quality, you also don't want to break the bank.
